# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Tetris Cooperative 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Me and my partner plan on making tetris but the game allows for 2 players to simulatneaously place blocks in the same screen therefore making the game harder. 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The videogame tetris is our main goal and to add a twist we plan on introducing a cooperative playstyle into the game in which 2 players will need to work together in placing blocks. We have no planned out how the game will be built just yet as this is just an idea. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I plan on working with Weiyang Zhang and his email is tup02253@temple.edu and TA is Zhengkang Fan. 


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

At the very least we have a functional barebone version of tetris that's playable, and has all the types of blocks. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better scenario would be to also include a difficulty increase, victory screen, and score keeper.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Ultimately the best thing would be to include the 2 player cooperative feature into it. 


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We are currently still discussing what we need to do in order to complete this project and have no assigned roles or objectives yet.
